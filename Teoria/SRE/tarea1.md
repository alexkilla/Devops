## Escribir diferencia entre SRE y DevOps

Taken from the SRE handbook:

`One could equivalently view SRE as a specific implementation of DevOps with some idiosyncratic extensions`

## Definitions

The official definition of DevOps is “a software engineering culture and practice, that aims at unifying software development and software operation.” The term was first coined by Andrew Shafer and Patrick Debois back in 2008.

The concept of Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) has been around since 2003, making it even older than DevOps. It was coined by Ben Treynor, who founded Google’s Site Reliability Team. According to Treynor, SRE is “what happens when a software engineer is tasked with what used to be called operations.”

## Conclusion

The main difference between the two concepts is that devops focuses on the 'what' and SRE focuses on how to bring the principles to a right workflow, with the right work methods, tools, etc.

The DevOps movement does not explicitly define how to succeed in these areas. In this way, DevOps is like an abstract class or interface in programming. It defines the overall behavior of the system, but the implementation details are left up to the author.

DevOps | SRE
--- | ---
| Reduce organization silos |  Share ownership with developers by using the same tools and  techniques across the stack
Accept failure as normal  |	Have a formula for balancing accidents and failures against new releases
Implement gradual change | Encourage moving quickly by reducing costs of failure
Leverage tooling & automation | Encourages "automating this year's job away" and minimizing manual systems work to focus on efforts that bring long-term value to the system
Measure everything	| Believes that operations is a software problem, and defines prescriptive ways for measuring availability, uptime, outages, toil, etc.
